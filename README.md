# Cupcake Corner

In this project we’re going to build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This will use a couple of forms, which are old news for you, but you’re also going to learn how to send and receive the order data from the internet, how to validate forms, and more.

## Features

Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about URLSession, the disabled() modifier, and more.

- Sending and receiving Codable data with URLSession and SwiftUI
- Loading an image from a remote server
- Validating and disabling forms
